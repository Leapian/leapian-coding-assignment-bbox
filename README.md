## Background
A PDF Document file contains information about the words on each PDF page, so that the PDF Renderer can draw these on the screen. 

> A little known fact is that the PDF File format stores the words "in a random order", ie words that belong to the same sentence may be saved in random locations (x,y coordinates) inside the PDF. 
This makes it very difficult to parse a PDF document and obtain sentences, which would be a requirement for any NLP text analysis that requires full sentences.

We can obtain the locations of words on a PDF page from a PDF parsing library. The coordinate system of a PDF starts with (x=0, y=0) in the top-left corner of a page. 
The bottom-right coordinate of the page is (x=pageWidth, y=pageHeight).
What we know about each individual word is the bounding box for that word. 
The format of the words bounding box is: 
top-left coordinate (wordX, wordY) relative to the **pageâ€™s top-left** coordinate and the **width** and **height** of the **rectangle**.

## Python Dataset Input
**In this exercise tou are given a data file with all bounding boxes of the words on thew first PDF page.**

The dataset script contains a single variable, data, which is a dictionary. Each item in the dictionary was obtained by splitting each row in the CSV file by the comma, thus obtaining between 8 & 9 items in each row. There are 9 items when the wordText contains a comma: i.e the original text in the document has a comma.

### Format of the dataset.py
```
# dataset.py
data = [
    ['pageId', 'wordId', 'wordIdOnPage', 'wordX', 'wordY', 'wordWidth', 'wordHeight', 'wordText'] ,
    ['0', '0', '0', '81.0718', '78.9557', '92.3539', '16.1216', 'Trace-based'] ,
		...
]
```

> Hint: you can now import this dataset in another script with `from dataset import data` # assuming dataset.py is in the same folder

## Data Ranges
- **pageID** from 0 to n-1 pages in the document
- **wordID** from 0 to n-1 words in the whole document
- **wordIDOnPage** from 0 to m-1 words on that same page

The bounding box is the box around a word. It consists of the top left x y coordinate of the word and the width and height.

## Additional Information
This is the first page of the sample document. 
The words are color coded by their word height, with blue words being the most frequent words on this page.

## Objectives
To compute some statistics about the proximity of words on a PDF page.

### Detailed Tasks
1. Create a class to represent one Word from the document, including its bounding box coordinates and text
2. Represent the dataset as a list of Words. Load each word from the dataset, representing each one with the data structure chosen for step 1. When loading words from the file, use the round(wordHeight) as the wordâ€™s wordHeight so that the word heights come in discrete values. Ie. a wordHeight = 8.015 from the file should be stored as 8.0 when loaded and a word with wordHeight = 7.70 should be 8.0.
3. Group all words that have the same word-height together (this is a reflection of words that have the same font).
4. Find out which is the most frequent group of word heights (ie. the main body of text)
5. Using only the main body of text and ignoring all other words:
    1. Group all the words by their y-coordinate (ie. place each word into a list that represents the words on the same line)
    2. Compute: the mean, mode and median of the vertical gap between lines of words
    3. Sort each word on each line by their x-coordinate so that they are ordered by their â€˜reading orderâ€™
    4. Compute: the mean, mode, median of the distance between words on each line, that belong to the same height

> 
There should be 720 words on this page. There should be 553 words that have a wordHeight >7.5 and <8.5 pixels.
